## Project Introduction

For a bit of festive fun ðŸŽ„, I built a flexdashboard from Fortnum & Mason's advert calendar ratings. Participants included:

-   Sofia Costa, resident wordsmith

-   Laura da Costa Williams, resident chef, with [green fingers](https://www.instagram.com/laura_surbangarden/)

-   Skye da Costa Williams, resident witch, with [crotchet hooks](https://www.instagram.com/skyescrochet/)

-   Me, resident R-nerd

[Fortnum & Mason](https://www.fortnumandmason.com/) was established in 1707, during that time it has been known for many things, including specialising in tin goods and becoming a post office. Today it's known for afternoon tea and food hampers. Their 2024 advent calendar for two consisted of two biscuits and two accompanying teas per day.

## Data

We all rated the biscuit, tea, and the pairing out of 10, recording our results in a dependable spreadsheet. After which I ingested and after a **few steps** created a flexdashboard. You can check these steps in this [repo](https://github.com/KurtisAsha/annual-advent-appraisal).

An idea of the data

```{r example, echo=FALSE}
advent_appraisals_2024 %>% 
 filter(day == 1) %>% 
  datatable(class = c('compact', 'hover', 'row-border'), 
           rownames = FALSE, 
           options = list(dom = 't'))

```

## Dashboard

A few navigation notes:

-   There are three tabs at the top: Tea, Biscuit, and Pairing

-   Each tab has:

    -   3 static value boxes: Best name, Best score, Average score

    -   An interactive line chart with hover functionality and click / doubleclick legend values

    -   An interactive bar chart, best used by hovering over a row and comparing values. The lower the value the closer that person scored. This was used to determine who had similar taste buds.

> Here is the [**Advent Dashboard**](https://rawcdn.githack.com/KurtisAsha/annual-advent-appraisal/0bf4b0f4813e3eebc95b12006af518bcf92cbdb8/advent-appraisal-2024.html)

## Notes

There was an issue of same scoring Tea, Biscuit, or pairing. The flexdashboard would push all other boxes out to accommodate multiple values. Luckily, in the end there was non.

It was a kind-of rush job, I wanted to show the dashboard close to finishing the advent calendars.

I showed the dashboard to all participants, were they interested? Well for 10 minutes until Christmas dinner was mentioned. Who can blame them ðŸ¤¤.
