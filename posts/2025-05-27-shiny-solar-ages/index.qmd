## Project Introduction

Inspired by my son's love for everything solar system and my wanting to play with [Shiny Assistant.](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/assistant/) I've built an app that takes your date of birth and displays your age for each of the major planets in our solar system.

## How to Use

Upon launching the app, you'll see all the controls on the left hand side. Add your date of birth to automatically display your solar ages.

There's also a toggle to switch to days calculation mode which requires a little explanation.

### Calculation Mode

Year: Gives your Earth age based on a planets orbit.

Day: Gives your Earth age based on a planets rotation.

Examples of how the calculation modes work using someone born 27th May 2005.

```{r calc-mode, echo=TRUE}
# Use age is converted to Earth days
age_difference_in_earth_days <- Sys.Date() -  ymd("2005-05-27")

# The Year calculation divides and floors by the number of Earth days of 
# a planet.
# Let's use Jupiter which orbits around the Sun every ~4331 Earth days.

jupiter_age_year_calc <- floor(age_difference_in_earth_days / 4331.984) |>  
 as.numeric()

# Jupiter age of 20 year old by years calculation
jupiter_age_year_calc

# The Days calculation converts your days Earth age to a planets equivalent. 
# Then divides and floors by an Earth year.
# Let's use Jupiter which rotates around it's axis every ~9.8 Earth hours

age_difference_in_jupiter_days <- age_difference_in_earth_days / (9.8/24)

jupiter_age_days_calc <- floor(age_difference_in_jupiter_days / 365.26) |>  
 as.numeric()

# Jupiter age of 20 year old by days calculation
jupiter_age_days_calc

```

Venus inspired the days-based calculation with it's day longer than it's year. Still wrapping my head around that.

## Dashboard

Well here it is, the [**Solar System Age Converter**](https://kurtisasha.shinyapps.io/solar-system-ages/)**.**

The app was the result of a 2 hour Shiny Assistant assisted play around, a feat I would have spent quadruple the time on. I am a fan of Shiny Assistant but I have notes:

-   Functions were sometimes implemented in code without calling the library.
-   It got stuck on the trickier css elements, in my case shadow-root constructed stylesheets.
-   I wish a button was introduced to take me to the editor rather than typing "Open the editor".
-   I could not clear the console.
-   I could use control + f but couldn't close.

It is probable I missed a bunch of functionality in my speed run and I'll aim to read around, see how others have fared.
