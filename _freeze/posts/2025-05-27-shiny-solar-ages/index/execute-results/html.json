Add your date of birth to automatically display your solar ages.\n\nThere's also a toggle to switch to days calculation mode which requires a little explanation.\n\n### Calculation Mode\n\nYear: Gives your Earth age based on a planets orbit.\n\nDay: Gives your Earth age based on a planets rotation.\n\nExamples of how the calculation modes work using someone born 27th May 2005.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use age is converted to Earth days\nage_difference_in_earth_days <- Sys.Date() -  ymd(\"2005-05-27\")\n\n# The Year calculation divides and floors by the number of Earth days of \n# a planet.\n# Let's use Jupiter which orbits around the Sun every ~4331 Earth days.\n\njupiter_age_year_calc <- floor(age_difference_in_earth_days / 4331.984) |>  \n as.numeric()\n\n# Jupiter age of 20 year old by years calculation\njupiter_age_year_calc\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# The Days calculation converts your days Earth age to a planets equivalent. \n# Then divides and floors by an Earth year.\n# Let's use Jupiter which rotates around it's axis every ~9.8 Earth hours\n\nage_difference_in_jupiter_days <- age_difference_in_earth_days / (9.8/24)\n\njupiter_age_days_calc <- floor(age_difference_in_jupiter_days / 365.26) |>  \n as.numeric()\n\n# Jupiter age of 20 year old by days calculation\njupiter_age_days_calc\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 49\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nVenus inspired the days-based calculation with it's day longer than it's year. Still wrapping my head around that.\n\n## Dashboard\n\nWell here it is, the [**Solar System Age Converter**](https://kurtisasha.shinyapps.io/solar-system-ages/)**.**\n\nThe app was the result of a 2 hour Shiny Assistant assisted play around, a feat I would have spent quadruple the time on. I am a fan of Shiny Assistant but I have notes:\n\n-   Functions were sometimes implemented in code without calling the library.\n-   It got stuck on the trickier css elements, in my case shadow-root constructed stylesheets.\n-   I wish a button was introduced to take me to the editor rather than typing \"Open the editor\".\n-   I could not clear the console.\n-   I could use control + f but couldn't close.\n\nIt is probable I missed a bunch of functionality in my speed run and I'll aim to read around, see how others have fared.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n[Winston Chang](https://github.com/wch) for Shiny Assistant.\n\n[Royal Museums Greenwich](https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/space-astronomy/solar-system-data) for solar system information.\n\n[r-bloggers.com](r-bloggers.com) for the reach, platform, and content\n\nPackages and package maintainer(s):\n\n-   lubridate \\| Vitalie Spinu\n",
